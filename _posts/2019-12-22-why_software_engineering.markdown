I decided to learn Software Engineering because I think technology is incredible! I work in healthcare and it amazing to see how technology is changing the industry. Currently, we are in the age of personalized medicine which tailors treatments to each individual person! This is all made possible because of research and technology. I would love to learn how technology is changing other industries too. Which is another reason why I decided to learn software engineering! Software engineers can work in a variety of different fields- everyone needs Software Engineers and they're only going to become more and more in demand as technology advances. I also love that Software Engineering is creative. My current profession is very analytical and I would enjoy having a little more creativity in my day to day life. My current profession is also very strict with the schedule and I would love to have more flexibility with my work days (and less weekends and holidays)! I'm very excited to begin my Software Engineer journey!
